// Improve Readability with TypeScript Numeric Separators when working with Large Numbers

// When looking at large numbers in code (such as 1800000) itâ€™s oftentimes difficult for the human eye to quickly see how big the number actually is. TypeScript allows us to use numeric separators to write numbers in a more human readable format (such as 1_800_000), while keeping the generated JavaScript unchanged.

class AmountInput {
  private static MAX_ALLOWED = 99_999_999;

  amount: number = 0;

  showTooltip() {
    //show tooltip
    setTimeout(() => {
      //hide tooltip
    }, 2_500);
  }

  formatMillion() {
    return this.amount / 1_000_000 + "M";
  }
}
